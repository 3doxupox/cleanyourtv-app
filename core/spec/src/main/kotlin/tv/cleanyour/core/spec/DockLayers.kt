// The dock and the rows under it, as the launcher builds them (AppAdapter.reload and MainActivity
// at upstream main): every app is sorted by its place in dock_apps first, the grid has `columns`
// tiles per row and its first row is the dock, and rows_below_dock grid rows stay in view under
// it. So the phone keeps one ordered list and cuts it into rows of `columns`: the first row is the
// dock, the next are Row 2 and Row 3. A row only ever holds apps once the rows above it are full,
// because a gap would make the launcher slide the next apps up into it; the cut list cannot have
// one. The phone offers at most MAX_ROWS rows (the dock and two under it).
//
// On the TV, an app in dock_apps that is not there (uninstalled, switched off, no TV launcher
// activity) is skipped and every later app moves up a slot. `decode` applies the same rule, so
// the sheet shows what the TV shows.

    // is written false. Launcher 2.4 fits the rows to the screen, and the focused app's name above

    // rows fit. One or two rows leave the theme's dock_title as it is. Launcher 2.0 ignores the key.

    // rows_below_dock 0. Its 68 sp name, Last opened line and dots stand taller than the room the
    // launcher keeps for a dock title (TITLE_ROOM_DP, made for the 48 sp name), so a row in view
    // under the dock pushed the name up into the clock. The rows still hold their apps: dock_apps
    // keeps the whole list in order, so on the TV they are the first rows of the grid, peeking under
    // the dock, one press of Down away.

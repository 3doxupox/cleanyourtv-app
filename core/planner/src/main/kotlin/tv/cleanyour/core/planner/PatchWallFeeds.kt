// beta4, incident of 0.4.6-beta2 (issues #945, #1570): never PatchWall's feeds off while PatchWall
// stays on. A Xiaomi MiTV-AXSO2 on Android 11 kept PatchWall on (an owner's choice row since issue
// #111) with Mi TV+ and com.xm.webcontent switched off and its own home screen off, and was stuck
// loading after a restart; Xiaomi's Android 11 firmware opens PatchWall at boot (#1580). Every tested
// list switches PatchWall off together with its feeds. Shared by the planner (Setup, Switch off,
// Leftovers, Put back) and HomeSwitchRisk (no switch while a feed stays off).

// 0.4.0: the person's own photo for one TV. The phone makes it (crop to 16:9, 1920 x 1080, a JPEG of
// at most MAX_BYTES, re-encoded so no metadata such as the place or the camera is left) and keeps it
// in the app's private files at tvs/<id>/picture.jpg: not backed up, gone with "Forget this TV",
// never in a TV report or a restore point. Each push puts it into the BlobStore (a cache the system
// may clear) and sends it as the launcher's wallpaper.jpg, the same push a look's own picture takes.
// A newly made photo is only staged (stage: the BlobStore, for the preview and the push) and kept
// (keep) once "Use this look" has put it on the TV, so the kept copy, and "Restore mine", is always
// the photo the TV last got from this phone.
